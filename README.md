# **CIFAR-10 Image Classification (ANN & CNN)**  

This project implements image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using:  
- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** â€“ Fully connected layers trained for 5 epochs.  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** â€“ Convolutional layers for better feature extraction, trained for 10 epochs.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… **Preprocessing** â€“ Image normalization for better training.  
âœ… **ANN Model** â€“ Dense layers with ReLU activation.  
âœ… **CNN Model** â€“ Convolutional layers with pooling for feature extraction.  
âœ… **Evaluation** â€“ Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  

## ðŸ“ŠResults 
ðŸš€ CNN performs better than ANN due to its ability to extract spatial features.
